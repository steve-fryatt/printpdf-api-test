PrintPDFAPITest
=======

Test PrintPDF's external control API.


Introduction
------------

[PrintPDF](https://github.com/steve-fryatt/printpdf) offers an external API to enable other applications some control over the generation of PDF documents. This is implemented by way of a collection of Wimp User Messages.

PrintPDFAPITest has been written to enable PrintPDF's API to be tested during development.


Building
--------

PrintPDFAPITest consists of a collection of un-tokenised BASIC, which must be assembled using the [SFTools build environment](https://github.com/steve-fryatt). It will be necessary to have suitable Linux system with a working installation of the [GCCSDK](http://www.riscos.info/index.php/GCCSDK) to be able to make use of this.

With a suitable build environment set up, making PrintPDFAPITest is a matter of running

	make

from the root folder of the project. This will build everything from source, and assemble a working !PrintPDFAPITest application and its associated files within the build folder. If you have access to this folder from RISC OS (either via HostFS, LanManFS, NFS, Sunfish or similar), it will be possible to run it directly once built.

To clean out all of the build files, use

	make clean

To make a release version and package it into Zip files for distribution, use

	make release

This will clean the project and re-build it all, then create a distribution archive (no source), source archive and RiscPkg package in the folder within which the project folder is located. By default the output of `git describe` is used to version the build, but a specific version can be applied by setting the `VERSION` variable -- for example

	make release VERSION=1.23
